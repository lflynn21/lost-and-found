# Lost and Found App

Developed as a group project in CS 3240 (Fall 2023), this Django app is hosted on Heroku and uses a PostgreSQL database. It is designed to help UVA students recover items they lost by posting about missing items, posting about items they found which someone else lost, and helping unite people to their lost items which others dropped off.
